## Your Google Listing Is Your Storefront. Treat It Like One.

Before a homeowner in Dorado or Carolina even visits your website, they see your **Google Business Profile**. That card in Google Maps with your name, photos, reviews, and hours — it either builds trust instantly, or it sends the lead to the next contractor in the list.

Most contractors set it up once and forget it. That's a mistake worth thousands.

## Mistake #1: No Photos (Or Bad Ones)

Profiles with **100+ photos** get **520% more calls** than those with none. Yet most contractor profiles have 2-3 blurry cell phone shots of a finished roof taken from 50 feet away.

**Fix it:** After every job, take 3-5 photos. Before, during, and after. Close-ups of materials. Wide shots of the finished project. Upload them weekly. Google rewards fresh content.

## Mistake #2: Wrong Business Category

If your primary category is "Contractor" instead of "Roofing Contractor" or "Solar Energy Company," Google doesn't know what you do. You're competing against general handymen instead of ranking for your specialty.

**Fix it:** Set the most specific primary category. Add secondary categories for additional services. "Roofing Contractor" + "Roof Repair Service" + "Gutter Cleaning Service" is far more powerful than just "Contractor."

## Mistake #3: Zero Reviews (Or No Responses)

Reviews are the **#1 factor** for local pack ranking. Contractors with 50+ reviews and an average above 4.5 stars dominate the map.

But here's what most miss: **responding to every review matters just as much.** Google sees engagement. Customers see professionalism.

**Fix it:** After every completed project, send a direct link to your review page. Keep it simple: "We'd appreciate a quick Google review." Then respond to every single one — positive and negative — within 48 hours.

## Mistake #4: Incomplete Service Area

Google lets you define the cities and towns you serve. If you left it blank or set it to "Puerto Rico" (the entire island), you're diluting your ranking power across an area you can't realistically cover.

**Fix it:** List the specific municipalities: San Juan, Dorado, Bayamón, Carolina, Caguas, Ponce — wherever you actually work. This tells Google to show you to people **in those areas** searching for your services.

## Mistake #5: No Website Link (Or a Dead One)

Your GBP has a website field. If it points to a dead page, a Facebook link, or a generic template site that takes 8 seconds to load, you're losing conversions at the finish line.

**Fix it:** Your website needs to load in under 2 seconds, be mobile-first (80%+ of local searches are mobile), and have a clear call-to-action above the fold. No sliders. No stock photos. Just your work, your number, and a reason to call.

## The Compound Effect

None of these fixes cost money. They cost **discipline**. The contractors who optimize their Google Business Profile and maintain it consistently — fresh photos, responses to reviews, correct categories — compound their visibility month after month.

In 6 months, they own the local pack. In 12 months, they stop needing to chase leads entirely.
