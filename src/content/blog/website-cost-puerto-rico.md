## The Real Answer: $800 to $10,000+

Every contractor and business owner in Puerto Rico asks the same question: _"How much for a website?"_

The answer depends on what you need — but here's the honest breakdown in 2026:

| Tier | Price Range | What You Get | Best For |
|------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| **Landing Page** | $800 – $2,500 | 1-page site, mobile-optimized, contact form, basic SEO | New businesses, solo contractors |
| **Authority System** | $3,000 – $5,000 | Multi-page site, full SEO, bilingual (EN/ES), blog, Google Business setup | Established businesses wanting leads |
| **Full Growth System** | $7,000 – $10,000+ | Everything above + cinematic video, Google Ads, content strategy, ongoing maintenance | Companies ready to dominate their market |

## Why the Range Is So Wide

Two roofing companies can both need a "website" — but one needs a single landing page with a phone number, and the other needs a full bilingual platform with project portfolio, SEO for 12 cities, and video production.

**The scope determines the price. Not the hours.**

## What Drives the Cost Up

1. **Number of pages** — A 1-page site costs less than a 10-page site
2. **Bilingual content** — EN + ES doubles the copywriting and translation work
3. **Custom design** — Template layouts vs fully custom, branded sections
4. **Photography / Video** — Stock photos vs a professional half-day shoot
5. **SEO depth** — Basic on-page vs city pages, blog strategy, and schema markup
6. **E-commerce** — Adding a store (products, payments, inventory) adds complexity
7. **Ongoing maintenance** — One-time handover vs managed monthly support

## What You Should NEVER Pay For

- **Hourly billing with no cap** — You'll end up paying $5K for a site worth $2K
- **Monthly "website rental"** — You don't own it. If you stop paying, it disappears
- **Hidden hosting fees** — Cloudflare Pages hosting is free. WordPress hosting is $20–$50/month
- **"SEO packages" with no reporting** — If they can't show you results, they're not doing SEO

## The Real Cost of a CHEAP Website

A $300 Fiverr site gets you:
- A WordPress template that loads in 6+ seconds
- No mobile optimization (60%+ of PR traffic is mobile)
- Zero SEO — invisible on Google
- No bilingual support
- No structured data for Google Business Profile
- A site that looks like every other generic contractor page

**That "savings" costs you thousands in lost leads every month.**

## What a Professional Website Actually Delivers

| Metric | Cheap Site | Professional Site |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Google PageSpeed | 30-50 | 90-100 |
| Mobile experience | Broken | Flawless |
| Google ranking | Page 5+ | Page 1 (with SEO work) |
| Load time | 4-8 seconds | Under 2 seconds |
| Lead conversion | ~1% | 3-8% |
| Bilingual | No | Full EN/ES |
| Google Business integration | None | Full schema markup |

## How to Choose the Right Investment

**Ask yourself:**

1. **How much is one new client worth?** A roofing job in PR averages $5K–$15K. If your website brings ONE extra job per month, a $3K website pays for itself in week one.

2. **Are you competing locally?** If competitors have professional sites and you don't, you're losing every Google search.

3. **Do you serve both English and Spanish speakers?** Puerto Rico is bilingual. A monolingual site misses half your market.

## Payment Structure (No Surprises)

At Lyrix Digital, we keep it simple:

- **50% deposit** — Before any work begins
- **50% on approval** — Before the site goes live
- **You own everything** — Source code, domain, hosting account
- **90-day support included** — Bugs, tweaks, and questions covered
- **No contracts** — Monthly maintenance is optional, never locked in

## The Bottom Line

A website in Puerto Rico costs $800–$10K+ depending on scope. The question isn't "can I afford a website?" — it's "can I afford NOT to have one while my competitors take every Google search?"

**Every month without a professional website is money left on the table.**
