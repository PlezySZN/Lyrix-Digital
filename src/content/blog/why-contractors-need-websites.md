## You Don't Own Facebook. Facebook Owns You.

Every week, another contractor in Puerto Rico loses their Facebook page. Algorithm change. Account suspension. Fake report from a competitor. Gone. Years of reviews, posts, and leads — erased overnight.

**Your website is the only digital asset you actually control.**

## The Numbers Don't Lie

- **93%** of online experiences begin with a search engine, not Facebook
- **75%** of users judge a company's credibility by their website design
- **Google My Business** listings with a website get **70% more clicks** than those without

## What a Real Contractor Website Does

A professional website isn't a digital brochure. It's a **24/7 sales machine** that:

1. **Ranks on Google** — When someone searches "roofing contractor San Juan," you show up
2. **Converts Visitors** — Clear CTAs, trust signals, and social proof turn browsers into callers
3. **Builds Authority** — Before/after galleries, certifications, and reviews establish dominance
4. **Captures Leads** — Contact forms with auto-response keep the pipeline flowing even at 2 AM

## The Facebook Trap

| Feature | Facebook | Your Website |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| You own it | ❌ | ✅ |
| Google ranking | ❌ | ✅ |
| Custom branding | ❌ | ✅ |
| Lead capture | Limited | ✅ |
| Can be deleted | ✅ Risk | ❌ |

## The Bottom Line

Your competitors who invest in a professional website are eating your lunch. They're showing up on Google while you're hoping the Facebook algorithm shows your post to 3% of your followers.

**Stop renting. Start owning.**
