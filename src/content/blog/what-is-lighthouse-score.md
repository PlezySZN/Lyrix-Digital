## Your Website Speed Is Costing You Money

Every second your website takes to load, you lose **7% of conversions**. That's not opinion — that's data from Google.

Most contractor websites in Puerto Rico score between 20-50 on Google Lighthouse. Ours score **100/100/100/100**.

## What Is Google Lighthouse?

Lighthouse is Google's open-source tool that audits websites across four categories:

- **Performance** — How fast your site loads
- **Accessibility** — Can everyone use it, including people with disabilities?
- **Best Practices** — Does it follow modern web standards?
- **SEO** — Is it optimized for search engines?

Each category scores 0-100. **A perfect score is 100 across all four.**

## Why This Matters for Contractors

### 1. Google Rewards Fast Sites
Google uses page speed as a ranking factor. A site scoring 100 on Performance loads in under 1 second. Your competitor's WordPress site? 4-8 seconds.

### 2. Mobile Users Won't Wait
**53% of mobile users abandon sites that take over 3 seconds to load.** In Puerto Rico, where mobile usage dominates, this is critical.

### 3. Accessibility = Larger Audience
ADA-compliant websites aren't just ethical — they're legally safer and reach more potential customers.

### 4. Better SEO = More Leads
Technical SEO (proper meta tags, structured data, canonical URLs) tells Google exactly what your business does and where you operate.

## The Lyrix Difference

Every website we build ships with a verified Lighthouse score of **100/100/100/100**. Not 90. Not 95. **One hundred.**

This isn't magic — it's engineering. We use:
- **Astro** — Zero JavaScript by default
- **Edge deployment** — Your site loads from the closest server to your visitor
- **Image optimization** — Every image is compressed and served in modern formats
- **Code splitting** — Only load what's visible on screen
