# LYRIX DIGITAL — Commercial Production Brief

## `Lyrix_Commercial_2026.mov`

---

## CONCEPT: "THE SYSTEM"

**Logline:** A 60-second cinematic piece that positions Lyrix Digital as the operating system behind Puerto Rico's most dominant businesses — not a vendor, but *infrastructure*.

**Tone:** Christopher Nolan meets Apple. Cold precision. Warm results. No smiling stock-photo people. No "Welcome to our agency." Every frame earns its place.

**Core Message:** *"Your competition is still on Facebook. You're about to own the entire grid."*

## TIMELINE

## TALENT & CREW

### On-Camera

| Role | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Contractor (Hero)** | Real contractor preferred — weathered hands, confident posture. 35-55, Puerto Rican. Wardrobe: clean work shirt, tool belt optional. NOT a model. |
| **Hands double** (if needed) | For macro steel beam shot |

### Crew (Minimum Viable)

| Role | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Director / DP | 1 | Lyrix team — you direct + shoot |
| AC / Focus puller | 1 | Critical for 85mm shallow DOF |

| Drone pilot (Part 107) | 1 | Can double as BTS |
| Editor / Colorist | 1 | Post-production (can be director) |
| V/O talent | 1 | Remote session OK (Source Connect) |

---

## COLOR & GRADE DIRECTION

| Element | Treatment |
|---------|-----------|
| **Overall** | Teal + orange split-toning, desaturated mid-tones |
| **Shadows** | Crushed to near-black, slight blue push |
| **Highlights** | Warm amber on skin, cool steel on metal |
| **Screen shots** | Native — preserve the `#0a0a0a` / `#CCFF00` as-is |
| **Drone aerials** | Slightly lifted blacks for atmospheric haze |
| **Contrast** | High. Filmic. S-curve in LOG → Rec.709 |
| **Reference** | David Fincher's *The Social Network* meets Apple "Shot on iPhone" |

---

## SOUND DESIGN DIRECTION

| Moment | Sound |
|--------|-------|
| 00:00 — Boot | Single cursor blink tick. Silence. Then mechanical key press. |
| 00:02 — Montage | Low analog synth drone (C2). Sub-bass rumble. |
| 00:10 — Drone rise | Real drone motor hum mixed LOW under score. Wind. |
| 00:15 — Match cut | Digital transition whoosh (short, not cheesy) |
| 00:18 — UI clicks | Subtle macOS-style click. Satisfying. |
| 00:24 — Contractor | Score adds percussion — taiko-style, spatial |
| 00:30 — Stats | Score hits apex. Hard cut = silence for 0.3s. Then resolves. |
| 00:40 — Montage | Rapid cuts sync to beat — each cut has a transient hit |
| 00:50 — Typography | Each line appears with a low-end thud |
| 00:54 — Black | TOTAL SILENCE. 1 full second. Power move. |
| 00:55 — Logo | Single piano note (A3) + gentle synth pad resolution |

**Music reference:** Trent Reznor / Atticus Ross — *The Social Network* OST, or Hans Zimmer's *Interstellar* quieter moments.

## BUDGET ESTIMATE (REFERENCE)

| Category | Range |
|----------|-------|
| Pre-production (scout, script, planning) | $500–$1,000 |
| Camera + lens rental (2 days) | $800–$1,500 |
| Drone rental + pilot (1 day) | $500–$1,000 |
| Lighting + grip (2 days) | $400–$800 |
| Crew (AC + Gaffer, 2 days) | $800–$1,600 |
| Talent (contractor, half day) | $300–$600 |
| V/O talent (remote session) | $400–$800 |
| Music license or custom score | $500–$2,000 |
| Post-production (edit, VFX, grade, sound) | $2,000–$4,000 |
| **TOTAL** | **$6,300–$13,300** |

> If Lyrix owns the camera + drone and directs in-house, the number drops significantly. The biggest line items become talent, crew support, and post.

## KEY CREATIVE RULES

1. **No stock footage.** Every frame is original or screen-captured from the real site.
2. **No "agency sizzle reel" energy.** This is a film, not a sales pitch.
3. **The website IS the product.** At least 30% of runtime shows the actual live site.
4. **Puerto Rico is a character.** The island's texture, light, and energy must be present.
5. **Silence is a weapon.** The 1-second black at 00:54 is non-negotiable. It separates amateurs from professionals.
